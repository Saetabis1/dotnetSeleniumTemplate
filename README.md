# dotnetSeleniumTemplate
A ready to roll template to start testing UI applications

It has 2 tests which both make a regular search in Google, however they are splitted in categories.

To run them you just have to use a plain 'dotnet test', if you want to run only one you can use dote 'dotnet test --filter "TestCategory = yourCategory"'

Supports parallel testing, config files, remote and local drivers.

Hope it gets usefull!
